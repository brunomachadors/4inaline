# 4 in a line

The four in a row rules are very simple. Itâ€™s always played with 2 players and in a 7x6 grid. Each turn each player puts a piece of his color inside a column and it will fall until it reaches the lowest available spot. The one who can put 4 pieces of the same color in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally wins. If no one manages to do it then the match ends in a draw.
